# metrics-collector
* Implements a collector for tracking web site usage data. The data is stored into an IBM Cloudant database.
* Includes a piwik based implementation for the tracking client code.
* Tracks not only page views but also events in a single-page or async application.

## Usage
**Configuring the Application:**

1. Request a tracking id for your application (at the moment, you can generate your own unique id).
2. Include the tracker.js as a script tag in every page you want to track. Include the site application id from #1

```html
     <script src="http://metrics-collectors.mybluemix.net/tracker.js" siteid="my.unique.id"/>
```

That's it! Tracking events will be generated and sent to the collector. You can peek at the data by using the Cloudant dashboard to browse the collector database.

**Configuring the collector**

You can specify the Cloudant URL as a System variable e.g:
CLOUDANT_URL=https://userid:password@userid.cloudant.com

If you are deploying the app to Bluemix, then you have more database configuration options:

1. Add a Cloudant Service and bind it to the app.
2. Specify the CLOUDANT_URL system variable as a user-defined environment variable in the Application properties

## Developing
If your application is dynamically updating part of DOM (based on search results for example), you will need to make extra calls to make sure the tracking click handlers are correctly updated.
For example:

```javascript
  //Use enableLinkTrackingForNode method to install the tracking handler on all the links under a specified DOM Node
  //Tip: always check for null in case tracker.js cannot be loaded
  if ( typeof _paq !== 'undefined'){
      _paq.push([ enableLinkTrackingForNode, $('#results')]);
  }
```

> Note: You can find additional documentation on events supported by piwik at [http://developer.piwik.org/guides/tracking-javascript-guide](http://developer.piwik.org/guides/tracking-javascript-guide)
